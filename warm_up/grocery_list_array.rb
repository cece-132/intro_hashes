# Looking at the collection above:

# 1. What is problematic about listing `fridge_items_1`
# as an array structured grocery list?
  # - should count the number of items rather than repeating them

# 2. What might be a more readable way to structure this?
  # - a hash values for the item to keep track of all the items
